Psalm 90
A Prayer of Moses the man of God.
90:1 Lord, thou hast been our dwelling-place
In all generations.
90:2 Before the mountains were brought forth,
Or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world,
Even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.
90:3 Thou turnest man to destruction,
And sayest, Return, ye children of men.
90:4 For a thousand years in thy sight
Are but as yesterday when it is past,
And as a watch in the night.
90:5 Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep:
In the morning they are like grass which groweth up.
90:6 In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up;
In the evening it is cut down, and withereth.
90:7 For we are consumed in thine anger,
And in thy wrath are we troubled.
90:8 Thou hast set our iniquities before thee,
Our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.
90:9 For all our days are passed away in thy wrath:
We bring our years to an end as a sigh.
90:10 The days of our years are threescore years and ten,
Or even by reason of strength fourscore years;
Yet is their pride but labor and sorrow;
For it is soon gone, and we fly away.
90:11 Who knoweth the power of thine anger,
And thy wrath according to the fear that is due unto thee?
90:12 So teach us to number our days,
That we may get us a heart of wisdom.
90:13 Return, O God; how long?
And let it repent thee concerning thy servants.
90:14 Oh satisfy us in the morning with thy lovingkindness,
That we may rejoice and be glad all our days.
90:15 Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us,
And the years wherein we have seen evil.
90:16 Let thy work appear unto thy servants,
And thy glory upon their children.
90:17 And let the favor of the Lord our God be upon us;
And establish thou the work of our hands upon us;
Yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.
Psalm 91
91:1 He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High
Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
91:2 I will say of God, He is my refuge and my fortress;
My God, in whom I trust.
91:3 For he will deliver thee from the snare of the fowler,
And from the deadly pestilence.
91:4 He will cover thee with his pinions,
And under his wings shalt thou take refuge:
His truth is a shield and a buckler.
91:5 Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night,
Nor for the arrow that flieth by day;
91:6 For the pestilence that walketh in darkness,
Nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.
91:7 A thousand shall fall at thy side,
And ten thousand at thy right hand;
But it shall not come nigh thee.
91:8 Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold,
And see the reward of the wicked.
91:9 For thou, O God, art my refuge!
Thou hast made the Most High thy habitation;
91:10 There shall no evil befall thee,
Neither shall any plague come nigh thy tent.
91:11 For he will give his angels charge over thee,
To keep thee in all thy ways.
91:12 They shall bear thee up in their hands,
Lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.
91:13 Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder:
The young lion and the serpent shalt thou trample under foot.
91:14 Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him:
I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.
91:15 He shall call upon me, and I will answer him;
I will be with him in trouble:
I will deliver him, and honor him.
91:16 With long life will I satisfy him,
And show him my salvation.
Psalm 92
A Psalm, a Song for the sabbath day.
92:1 It is a good thing to give thanks unto God,
And to sing praises unto thy name, O Most High;
92:2 To show forth thy lovingkindness in the morning,
And thy faithfulness every night,
92:3 With an instrument of ten strings, and with the psaltery;
With a solemn sound upon the harp.
92:4 For thou, God, hast made me glad through thy work:
I will triumph in the works of thy hands.
92:5 How great are thy works, O God!
Thy thoughts are very deep.
92:6 A brutish man knoweth not;
Neither doth a fool understand this:
92:7 When the wicked spring as the grass,
And when all the workers of iniquity do flourish;
It is that they shall be destroyed for ever.
92:8 But thou, O God, art on high for evermore.
92:9 For, lo, thine enemies, O God,
For, lo, thine enemies shall perish;
All the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.
92:10 But my horn hast thou exalted like the horn of the wild-ox:
I am anointed with fresh oil.
92:11 Mine eye also hath seen my desire on mine enemies,
Mine ears have heard my desire of the evil-doers that rise up against me.
92:12 The righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree:
He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
92:13 They are planted in the house of God;
They shall flourish in the courts of our God.
92:14 They shall still bring forth fruit in old age;
They shall be full of sap and green:
92:15 To show that God is upright;
He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
Psalm 93
93:1 God reigneth; he is clothed with majesty;
God is clothed with strength; he hath girded himself therewith:
The world also is established, that it cannot be moved.
93:2 Thy throne is established of old:
Thou art from everlasting.
93:3 The floods have lifted up, O God,
The floods have lifted up their voice;
The floods lift up their waves.
93:4 Above the voices of many waters,
The mighty breakers of the sea,
God on high is mighty.
93:5 Thy testimonies are very sure:
Holiness becometh thy house,
O God, for evermore.
Psalm 94
94:1 O God, thou God to whom vengeance belongeth,
Thou God to whom vengeance belongeth, shine forth.
94:2 Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth:
Render to the proud their desert.
94:3 God, how long shall the wicked,
How long shall the wicked triumph?
94:4 They prate, they speak arrogantly:
All the workers of iniquity boast themselves.
94:5 They break in pieces thy people, O God,
And afflict thy heritage.
94:6 They slay the widow and the sojourner,
And murder the fatherless.
94:7 And they say, God will not see,
Neither will the God of Jacob consider.
94:8 Consider, ye brutish among the people;
And ye fools, when will ye be wise?
94:9 He that planted the ear, shall he not hear?
He that formed the eye, shall he not see?
94:10 He that chastiseth the nations, shall not he correct,
Even he that teacheth man knowledge?
94:11 God knoweth the thoughts of man,
That they are vanity.
94:12 Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O God,
And teachest out of thy law;
94:13 That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity,
Until the pit be digged for the wicked.
94:14 For God will not cast off his people,
Neither will he forsake his inheritance.
94:15 For judgment shall return unto righteousness;
And all the upright in heart shall follow it.
94:16 Who will rise up for me against the evil-doers?
Who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?
94:17 Unless God had been my help,
My soul had soon dwelt in silence.
94:18 When I said, My foot slippeth;
Thy lovingkindness, O God, held me up.
94:19 In the multitude of my thoughts within me Thy comforts delight my soul.
94:20 Shall the throne of wickedness have fellowship with thee,
Which frameth mischief by statute?
94:21 They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous,
And condemn the innocent blood.
94:22 But God hath been my high tower,
And my God the rock of my refuge.
94:23 And he hath brought upon them their own iniquity,
And will cut them off in their own wickedness;
God our God will cut them off.
Psalm 95
95:1 Oh come, let us sing unto God;
Let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.
95:2 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving;
Let us make a joyful noise unto him with psalms.
95:3 For God is a great God,
And a great King above all gods.
95:4 In his hand are the deep places of the earth;
The heights of the mountains are his also.
95:5 The sea is his, and he made it;
And his hands formed the dry land.
95:6 Oh come, let us worship and bow down;
Let us kneel before God our Maker:
95:7 For he is our God,
And we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand.
To-day, oh that ye would hear his voice!
95:8 Harden not your heart, as at Meribah,
As in the day of Massah in the wilderness;
95:9 When your fathers tempted me,
Proved me, and saw my work.
95:10 Forty years long was I grieved with that generation,
And said, It is a people that do err in their heart,
And they have not known my ways:
95:11 Wherefore I sware in my wrath,
That they should not enter into my rest.
Psalm 96
96:1 Oh sing unto God a new song:
Sing unto God, all the earth.
96:2 Sing unto God, bless his name;
Show forth his salvation from day to day.
96:3 Declare his glory among the nations,
His marvellous works among all the peoples.
96:4 For great is God, and greatly to be praised:
He is to be feared above all gods.
96:5 For all the gods of the peoples are idols;
But God made the heavens.
96:6 Honor and majesty are before him:
Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.
96:7 Ascribe unto God, ye kindreds of the peoples,
Ascribe unto God glory and strength.
96:8 Ascribe unto God the glory due unto his name:
Bring an offering, and come into his courts.
96:9 Oh worship God in holy array:
Tremble before him, all the earth.
96:10 Say among the nations, God reigneth:
The world also is established that it cannot be moved:
He will judge the peoples with equity.
96:11 Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice;
Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof;
96:12 Let the field exult, and all that is therein;
Then shall all the trees of the wood sing for joy
96:13 Before God; for he cometh,
For he cometh to judge the earth:
He will judge the world with righteousness,
And the peoples with his truth.
Psalm 97
97:1 God reigneth; let the earth rejoice;
Let the multitude of isles be glad.
97:2 Clouds and darkness are round about him:
Righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.
97:3 A fire goeth before him,
And burneth up his adversaries round about.
97:4 His lightnings lightened the world:
The earth saw, and trembled.
97:5 The mountains melted like wax at the presence of God,
At the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.
97:6 The heavens declare his righteousness,
And all the peoples have seen his glory.
97:7 Let all them be put to shame that serve graven images,
That boast themselves of idols:
Worship him, all ye gods.
97:8 Zion heard and was glad,
And the daughters of Judah rejoiced,
Because of thy judgments, O God.
97:9 For thou, God, art most high above all the earth:
Thou art exalted far above all gods.
97:10 O ye that love God, hate evil:
He preserveth the souls of his saints;
He delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked.
97:11 Light is sown for the righteous,
And gladness for the upright in heart.
97:12 Be glad in God, ye righteous;
And give thanks to his holy memorial name.
Psalm 98
A Psalm.
98:1 Oh sing unto God a new song;
For he hath done marvellous things:
His right hand, and his holy arm, hath wrought salvation for him.
98:2 God hath made known his salvation:
His righteousness hath he openly showed in the sight of the nations.
98:3 He hath remembered his lovingkindness and his faithfulness toward the house of Israel:
All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
98:4 Make a joyful noise unto God, all the earth:
Break forth and sing for joy, yea, sing praises.
98:5 Sing praises unto God with the harp;
With the harp and the voice of melody.
98:6 With trumpets and sound of cornet
Make a joyful noise before the King, God.
98:7 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof;
The world, and they that dwell therein;
98:8 Let the floods clap their hands;
Let the hills sing for joy together
98:9 Before God; for he cometh to judge the earth:
He will judge the world with righteousness,
And the peoples with equity.
Psalm 99
99:1 God reigneth; let the peoples tremble:
He sitteth above the cherubim; let the earth be moved.
99:2 God is great in Zion;
And he is high above all the peoples.
99:3 Let them praise thy great and terrible name:
Holy is he.
99:4 The king’s strength also loveth justice;
Thou dost establish equity;
Thou executest justice and righteousness in Jacob.
99:5 Exalt ye God our God,
And worship at his footstool:
Holy is he.
99:6 Moses and Aaron among his priests,
And Samuel among them that call upon his name;
They called upon God, and he answered them.
99:7 He spake unto them in the pillar of cloud:
They kept his testimonies,
And the statute that he gave them.
99:8 Thou answeredst them, O God our God:
Thou wast a God that forgavest them,
Though thou tookest vengeance of their doings.
99:9 Exalt ye God our God,
And worship at his holy hill;
For God our God is holy.
Psalm 100
A Psalm of thanksgiving.
100:1 Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands.
100:2 Serve God with gladness:
Come before his presence with singing.
100:3 Know ye that God, he is God:
It is he that hath made us, and we are his;
We are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
100:4 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving,
And into his courts with praise:
Give thanks unto him, and bless his name.
100:5 For God is good; his lovingkindness endureth for ever,
And his faithfulness unto all generations.
Psalm 101
A Psalm of David.
101:1 I will sing of lovingkindness and justice:
Unto thee, O God, will I sing praises.
101:2 I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way:
Oh when wilt thou come unto me?
I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.
101:3 I will set no base thing before mine eyes:
I hate the work of them that turn aside;
It shall not cleave unto me.
101:4 A perverse heart shall depart from me:
I will know no evil thing.
101:5 Whoso privily slandereth his neighbor, him will I destroy:
Him that hath a high look and a proud heart will I not suffer.
101:6 Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me:
He that walketh in a perfect way, he shall minister unto me.
101:7 He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house:
He that speaketh falsehood shall not be established before mine eyes.
101:8 Morning by morning will I destroy all the wicked of the land;
To cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of God.
Psalm 102
A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and poureth out his complaint before God.
102:1 Hear my prayer, O God,
And let my cry come unto thee.
102:2 Hide not thy face from me in the day of my distress:
Incline thine ear unto me;
In the day when I call answer me speedily.
102:3 For my days consume away like smoke,
And my bones are burned as a firebrand.
102:4 My heart is smitten like grass, and withered;
For I forget to eat my bread.
102:5 By reason of the voice of my groaning
My bones cleave to my flesh.
102:6 I am like a pelican of the wilderness;
I am become as an owl of the waste places.
102:7 I watch, and am become like a sparrow
That is alone upon the house-top.
102:8 Mine enemies reproach me all the day;
They that are mad against me do curse by me.
102:9 For I have eaten ashes like bread,
And mingled my drink with weeping,
102:10 Because of thine indignation and thy wrath:
For thou hast taken me up, and cast me away.
102:11 My days are like a shadow that declineth;
And I am withered like grass.
102:12 But thou, O God, wilt abide for ever;
And thy memorial name unto all generations.
102:13 Thou wilt arise, and have mercy upon Zion;
For it is time to have pity upon her,
Yea, the set time is come.
102:14 For thy servants take pleasure in her stones,
And have pity upon her dust.
102:15 So the nations shall fear the name of God,
And all the kings of the earth thy glory.
102:16 For God hath built up Zion;
He hath appeared in his glory.
102:17 He hath regarded the prayer of the destitute,
And hath not despised their prayer.
102:18 This shall be written for the generation to come;
And a people which shall be created shall praise God.
102:19 For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary;
From heaven did God behold the earth;
102:20 To hear the sighing of the prisoner;
To loose those that are appointed to death;
102:21 That men may declare the name of God in Zion,
And his praise in Jerusalem;
102:22 When the peoples are gathered together,
And the kingdoms, to serve God.
102:23 He weakened my strength in the way;
He shortened my days.
102:24 I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days:
Thy years are throughout all generations.
102:25 Of old didst thou lay the foundation of the earth;
And the heavens are the work of thy hands.
102:26 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure;
Yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment;
As a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed:
102:27 But thou art the same,
And thy years shall have no end.
102:28 The children of thy servants shall continue,
And their seed shall be established before thee.
Psalm 103
A Psalm of David.
103:1 Bless God, O my soul;
And all that is within me, bless his holy name.
103:2 Bless God, O my soul,
And forget not all his benefits:
103:3 Who forgiveth all thine iniquities;
Who healeth all thy diseases;
103:4 Who redeemeth thy life from destruction;
Who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;
103:5 Who satisfieth thy desire with good things,
So that thy youth is renewed like the eagle.
103:6 God executeth righteous acts,
And judgments for all that are oppressed.
103:7 He made known his ways unto Moses,
His doings unto the children of Israel.
103:8 God is merciful and gracious,
Slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness.
103:9 He will not always chide;
Neither will he keep his anger for ever.
103:10 He hath not dealt with us after our sins,
Nor rewarded us after our iniquities.
103:11 For as the heavens are high above the earth,
So great is his lovingkindness toward them that fear him.
103:12 As far as the east is from the west,
So far hath he removed our transgressions from us.
103:13 Like as a father pitieth his children,
So God pitieth them that fear him.
103:14 For he knoweth our frame;
He remembereth that we are dust.
103:15 As for man, his days are as grass;
As a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.
103:16 For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone;
And the place thereof shall know it no more.
103:17 But the lovingkindness of God is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him,
And his righteousness unto children’s children;
103:18 To such as keep his covenant,
And to those that remember his precepts to do them.
103:19 God hath established his throne in the heavens;
And his kingdom ruleth over all.
103:20 Bless God, ye his angels,
That are mighty in strength, that fulfil his word,
Hearkening unto the voice of his word.
103:21 Bless God, all ye his hosts,
Ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.
103:22 Bless God, all ye his works,
In all places of his dominion:
Bless God, O my soul.
Psalm 104
104:1 Bless God, O my soul.
O God my God, thou art very great;
Thou art clothed with honor and majesty:
104:2 Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment;
Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain;
104:3 Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters;
Who maketh the clouds his chariot;
Who walketh upon the wings of the wind;
104:4 Who maketh winds his messengers;
Flames of fire his ministers;
104:5 Who laid the foundations of the earth,
That it should not be moved for ever.
104:6 Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a vesture;
The waters stood above the mountains.
104:7 At thy rebuke they fled;
At the voice of thy thunder they hasted away
104:8 (The mountains rose, the valleys sank down)
Unto the place which thou hadst founded for them.
104:9 Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over;
That they turn not again to cover the earth.
104:10 He sendeth forth springs into the valleys;
They run among the mountains;
104:11 They give drink to every beast of the field;
The wild asses quench their thirst.
104:12 By them the birds of the heavens have their habitation;
They sing among the branches.
104:13 He watereth the mountains from his chambers:
The earth is filled with the fruit of thy works.
104:14 He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle,
And herb for the service of man;
That he may bring forth food out of the earth,
104:15 And wine that maketh glad the heart of man,
And oil to make his face to shine,
And bread that strengtheneth man’s heart.
104:16 The trees of God are filled with moisture,
The cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;
104:17 Where the birds make their nests:
As for the stork, the fir-trees are her house.
104:18 The high mountains are for the wild goats;
The rocks are a refuge for the conies.
104:19 He appointed the moon for seasons:
The sun knoweth his going down.
104:20 Thou makest darkness, and it is night,
Wherein all the beasts of the forest creep forth.
104:21 The young lions roar after their prey,
And seek their food from God.
104:22 The sun ariseth, they get them away,
And lay them down in their dens.
104:23 Man goeth forth unto his work
And to his labor until the evening.
104:24 O God, how manifold are thy works!
In wisdom hast thou made them all:
The earth is full of thy riches.
104:25 Yonder is the sea, great and wide,
Wherein are things creeping innumerable,
Both small and great beasts.
104:26 There go the ships;
There is leviathan, whom thou hast formed to play therein.
104:27 These wait all for thee,
That thou mayest give them their food in due season.
104:28 Thou givest unto them, they gather;
Thou openest thy hand, they are satisfied with good.
104:29 Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled;
Thou takest away their breath, they die,
And return to their dust.
104:30 Thou sendest forth thy Spirit, they are created;
And thou renewest the face of the ground.
104:31 Let the glory of God endure for ever;
Let God rejoice in his works:
104:32 Who looketh on the earth, and it trembleth;
He toucheth the mountains, and they smoke.
104:33 I will sing unto God as long as I live:
I will sing praise to my God while I have any being.
104:34 Let thy meditation be sweet unto him:
I will rejoice in God.
104:35 Let sinners be consumed out of the earth.
And let the wicked be no more.
Bless God, O my soul.
Praise ye God.
Psalm 105
105:1 Oh give thanks unto God, call upon his name;
Make known among the peoples his doings.
105:2 Sing unto him, sing praises unto him;
Talk ye of all his marvelous works.
105:3 Glory ye in his holy name:
Let the heart of them rejoice that seek God.
105:4 Seek ye God and his strength;
Seek his face evermore.
105:5 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done,
His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,
105:6 O ye seed of Abraham his servant,
Ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.
105:7 He is God our God:
His judgments are in all the earth.
105:8 He hath remembered his covenant for ever,
The word which he commanded to a thousand generations,
105:9 The covenant which he made with Abraham,
And his oath unto Isaac,
105:10 And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a statute,
To Israel for an everlasting covenant,
105:11 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan,
The lot of your inheritance;
105:12 When they were but a few men in number,
Yea, very few, and sojourners in it.
105:13 And they went about from nation to nation,
From one kingdom to another people.
105:14 He suffered no man to do them wrong;
Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,
105:15 Saying, Touch not mine anointed ones,
And do my prophets no harm.
105:16 And he called for a famine upon the land;
He brake the whole staff of bread.
105:17 He sent a man before them;
Joseph was sold for a servant:
105:18 His feet they hurt with fetters:
He was laid in chains of iron,
105:19 Until the time that his word came to pass,
The word of God tried him.
105:20 The king sent and loosed him;
Even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free.
105:21 He made him lord of his house,
And ruler of all his substance;
105:22 To bind his princes at his pleasure,
And teach his elders wisdom.
105:23 Israel also came into Egypt;
And Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
105:24 And he increased his people greatly,
And made them stronger than their adversaries.
105:25 He turned their heart to hate his people,
To deal subtly with his servants.
105:26 He sent Moses his servant,
And Aaron whom he had chosen.
105:27 They set among them his signs,
And wonders in the land of Ham.
105:28 He sent darkness, and made it dark;
And they rebelled not against his words.
105:29 He turned their waters into blood,
And slew their fish.
105:30 Their land swarmed with frogs In the chambers of their kings.
105:31 He spake, and there came swarms of flies,
And lice in all their borders.
105:32 He gave them hail for rain,
And flaming fire in their land.
105:33 He smote their vines also and their fig-trees,
And brake the trees of their borders.
105:34 He spake, and the locust came,
And the grasshopper, and that without number,
105:35 And did eat up every herb in their land,
And did eat up the fruit of their ground.
105:36 He smote also all the first-born in their land,
The chief of all their strength.
105:37 And he brought them forth with silver and gold;
And there was not one feeble person among his tribes.
105:38 Egypt was glad when they departed;
For the fear of them had fallen upon them.
105:39 He spread a cloud for a covering,
And fire to give light in the night.
105:40 They asked, and he brought quails,
And satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
105:41 He opened the rock, and waters gushed out;
They ran in the dry places like a river.
105:42 For he remembered his holy word,
And Abraham his servant.
105:43 And he brought forth his people with joy,
And his chosen with singing.
105:44 And he gave them the lands of the nations;
And they took the labor of the peoples in possession:
105:45 That they might keep his statutes,
And observe his laws.
Praise ye God.
Psalm 106
106:1 Praise ye God.
Oh give thanks unto God; for he is good;
For his lovingkindness endureth forever.
106:2 Who can utter the mighty acts of God,
Or show forth all his praise?
106:3 Blessed are they that keep justice,
And he that doeth righteousness at all times.
106:4 Remember me, O God, with the favor that thou bearest unto thy people;
Oh visit me with thy salvation,
106:5 That I may see the prosperity of thy chosen,
That I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation,
That I may glory with thine inheritance.
106:6 We have sinned with our fathers,
We have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.
106:7 Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt;
They remembered not the multitude of thy lovingkindnesses,
But were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.
106:8 Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake,
That he might make his mighty power to be known.
106:9 He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up:
So he led them through the depths, as through a wilderness.
106:10 And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them,
And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
106:11 And the waters covered their adversaries;
There was not one of them left.
106:12 Then believed they his words;
They sang his praise.
106:13 They soon forgat his works;
They waited not for his counsel,
106:14 But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness,
And tempted God in the desert.
106:15 And he gave them their request,
But sent leanness into their soul.
106:16 They envied Moses also in the camp,
And Aaron the saint of God.
106:17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan,
And covered the company of Abiram.
106:18 And a fire was kindled in their company;
The flame burned up the wicked.
106:19 They made a calf in Horeb,
And worshipped a molten image.
106:20 Thus they changed their glory
For the likeness of an ox that eateth grass.
106:21 They forgat God their Saviour,
Who had done great things in Egypt,
106:22 Wondrous works in the land of Ham,
And terrible things by the Red Sea.
106:23 Therefore he said that he would destroy them,
Had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach,
To turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.
106:24 Yea, they despised the pleasant land,
They believed not his word,
106:25 But murmured in their tents,
And hearkened not unto the voice of God.
106:26 Therefore he sware unto them,
That he would overthrow them in the wilderness,
106:27 And that he would overthrow their seed among the nations,
And scatter them in the lands.
106:28 They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor,
And ate the sacrifices of the dead.
106:29 Thus they provoked him to anger with their doings;
And the plague brake in upon them.
106:30 Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment;
And so the plague was stayed.
106:31 And that was reckoned unto him for righteousness,
Unto all generations for evermore.
106:32 They angered him also at the waters of Meribah,
So that it went ill with Moses for their sakes;
106:33 Because they were rebellious against his spirit,
And he spake unadvisedly with his lips.
106:34 They did not destroy the peoples,
As God commanded them,
106:35 But mingled themselves with the nations,
And learned their works,
106:36 And served their idols,
Which became a snare unto them.
106:37 Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons,
106:38 And shed innocent blood,
Even the blood of their sons and of their daughters,
Whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan;
And the land was polluted with blood.
106:39 Thus were they defiled with their works,
And played the harlot in their doings.
106:40 Therefore was the wrath of God kindled against his people,
And he abhorred his inheritance.
106:41 And he gave them into the hand of the nations;
And they that hated them ruled over them.
106:42 Their enemies also oppressed them,
And they were brought into subjection under their hand.
106:43 Many times did he deliver them;
But they were rebellious in their counsel,
And were brought low in their iniquity.
106:44 Nevertheless he regarded their distress,
When he heard their cry:
106:45 And he remembered for them his covenant,
And repented according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.
106:46 He made them also to be pitied
Of all those that carried them captive.
106:47 Save us, O God our God,
And gather us from among the nations,
To give thanks unto thy holy name,
And to triumph in thy praise.
106:48 Blessed be God, the God of Israel,
From everlasting even to everlasting.
And let all the people say, Amen.
Praise ye God.
BOOK V
Psalm 107
107:1 O give thanks unto God;
For he is good;
For his lovingkindness endureth for ever.
107:2 Let the redeemed of God say so,
Whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the adversary,
107:3 And gathered out of the lands,
From the east and from the west,
From the north and from the south.
107:4 They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way;
They found no city of habitation.
107:5 Hungry and thirsty,
Their soul fainted in them.
107:6 Then they cried unto God in their trouble,
And he delivered them out of their distresses,
107:7 He led them also by a straight way,
That they might go to a city of habitation.
107:8 Oh that men would praise God for his lovingkindness,
And for his wonderful works to the children of men!
107:9 For he satisfieth the longing soul,
And the hungry soul he filleth with good.
107:10 Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death,
Being bound in affliction and iron,
107:11 Because they rebelled against the words of God,
And contemned the counsel of the Most High:
107:12 Therefore he brought down their heart with labor;
They fell down, and there was none to help.
107:13 Then they cried unto God in their trouble,
And he saved them out of their distresses.
107:14 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death,
And brake their bonds in sunder.
107:15 Oh that men would praise God for his lovingkindness,
And for his wonderful works to the children of men!
107:16 For he hath broken the gates of brass,
And cut the bars of iron in sunder.
107:17 Fools because of their transgression,
And because of their iniquities, are afflicted.
107:18 Their soul abhorreth all manner of food;
And they draw near unto the gates of death.
107:19 Then they cry unto God in their trouble,
And he saveth them out of their distresses.
107:20 He sendeth his word, and healeth them,
And delivereth them from their destructions.
107:21 Oh that men would praise God for his lovingkindness,
And for his wonderful works to the children of men!
107:22 And let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving,
And declare his works with singing.
107:23 They that go down to the sea in ships,
That do business in great waters;
107:24 These see the works of God,
And his wonders in the deep.
107:25 For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind,
Which lifteth up the waves thereof.
107:26 They mount up to the heavens, they go down again to the depths:
Their soul melteth away because of trouble.
107:27 They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man,
And are at their wits’ end.
107:28 Then they cry unto God in their trouble,
And he bringeth them out of their distresses.
107:29 He maketh the storm a calm,
So that the waves thereof are still.
107:30 Then are they glad because they are quiet;
So he bringeth them unto their desired haven.
107:31 Oh that men would praise God for his lovingkindness,
And for his wonderful works to the children of men!
107:32 Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people,
And praise him in the seat of the elders.
107:33 He turneth rivers into a wilderness,
And watersprings into a thirsty ground;
107:34 A fruitful land into a salt desert,
For the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
107:35 He turneth a wilderness into a pool of water,
And a dry land into watersprings.
107:36 And there he maketh the hungry to dwell,
That they may prepare a city of habitation,
107:37 And sow fields, and plant vineyards,
And get them fruits of increase.
107:38 He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly;
And he suffereth not their cattle to decrease.
107:39 Again, they are diminished and bowed down
Through oppression, trouble, and sorrow.
107:40 He poureth contempt upon princes,
And causeth them to wander in the waste, where there is no way.
107:41 Yet setteth he the needy on high from affliction,
And maketh him families like a flock.
107:42 The upright shall see it, and be glad;
And all iniquity shall stop her mouth.
107:43 Whoso is wise will give heed to these things;
And they will consider the lovingkindnesses of God.
Psalm 108
A Song, A Psalm of David.
108:1 My heart is fixed, O God; I will sing, yea,
I will sing praises, even with my glory.
108:2 Awake, psaltery and harp:
I myself will awake right early.
108:3 I will give thanks unto thee, O God, among the peoples;
And I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.
108:4 For thy lovingkindness is great above the heavens;
And thy truth reacheth unto the skies.
108:5 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens,
And thy glory above all the earth.
108:6 That thy beloved may be delivered,
Save with thy right hand, and answer us.
108:7 God hath spoken in his holiness: I will exult;
I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
108:8 Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine;
Ephraim also is the defence of my head;
Judah is my sceptre.
108:9 Moab is my washpot;
Upon Edom will I cast my shoe;
Over Philistia will I shout.
108:10 Who will bring me into the fortified city?
Who hath led me unto Edom?
108:11 Hast not thou cast us off, O God?
And thou goest not forth, O God, with our hosts.
108:12 Give us help against the adversary;
For vain is the help of man.
108:13 Through God we shall do valiantly:
For he it is that will tread down our adversaries.
Psalm 109
For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.
109:1 Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;
109:2 For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit have they opened against me:
They have spoken unto me with a lying tongue.
109:3 They have compassed me about also with words of hatred,
And fought against me without a cause.
109:4 For my love they are my adversaries:
But I give myself unto prayer.
109:5 And they have rewarded me evil for good,
And hatred for my love.
109:6 Set thou a wicked man over him;
And let an adversary stand at his right hand.
109:7 When he is judged, let him come forth guilty;
And let his prayer be turned into sin.
109:8 Let his days be few;
And let another take his office.
109:9 Let his children be fatherless,
And his wife a widow.
109:10 Let his children be vagabonds, and beg;
And let them seek their bread out of their desolate places.
109:11 Let the extortioner catch all that he hath;
And let strangers make spoil of his labor.
109:12 Let there be none to extend kindness unto him;
Neither let there be any to have pity on his fatherless children.
109:13 Let his posterity be cut off;
In the generation following let their name be blotted out.
109:14 Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with God;
And let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.
109:15 Let them be before God continually,
That he may cut off the memory of them from the earth;
109:16 Because he remembered not to show kindness,
But persecuted the poor and needy man,
And the broken in heart, to slay them.
109:17 Yea, he loved cursing, and it came unto him;
And he delighted not in blessing, and it was far from him.
109:18 He clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment,
And it came into his inward parts like water,
And like oil into his bones.
109:19 Let it be unto him as the raiment wherewith he covereth himself,
And for the girdle wherewith he is girded continually.
109:20 This is the reward of mine adversaries from God,
And of them that speak evil against my soul.
109:21 But deal thou with me, O God the Lord, for thy name’s sake:
Because thy lovingkindness is good, deliver thou me;
109:22 For I am poor and needy,
And my heart is wounded within me.
109:23 I am gone like the shadow when it declineth:
I am tossed up and down as the locust.
109:24 My knees are weak through fasting;
And my flesh faileth of fatness.
109:25 I am become also a reproach unto them:
When they see me, they shake their head.
109:26 Help me, O God my God;
Oh save me according to thy lovingkindness:
109:27 That they may know that this is thy hand;
That thou, God, hast done it.
109:28 Let them curse, but bless thou:
When they arise, they shall be put to shame,
But thy servant shall rejoice.
109:29 Let mine adversaries be clothed with dishonor,
And let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a robe.
109:30 I will give great thanks unto God with my mouth;
Yea, I will praise him among the multitude.
109:31 For he will stand at the right hand of the needy,
To save him from them that judge his soul.
Psalm 110
A Psalm of David.
110:1 God saith unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand,
Until I make thine enemies thy footstool.
110:2 God will send forth the rod of thy strength out of Zion:
Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.
110:3 Thy people offer themselves willingly 
In the day of thy power, in holy array:
Out of the womb of the morning
Thou hast the dew of thy youth.
110:4 God hath sworn, and will not repent:
Thou art a priest for ever
After the order of Melchizedek.
110:5 The Lord at thy right hand
Will strike through kings in the day of his wrath.
110:6 He will judge among the nations,
He will fill the places with dead bodies;
He will strike through the head in many countries.
110:7 He will drink of the brook in the way:
Therefore will he lift up the head.
Psalm 111
111:1 Praise ye God.
I will give thanks unto God with my whole heart,
In the council of the upright, and in the congregation.
111:2 The works of God are great,
Sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.
111:3 His work is honor and majesty;
And his righteousness endureth for ever.
111:4 He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered:
God is gracious and merciful.
111:5 He hath given food unto them that fear him:
He will ever be mindful of his covenant.
111:6 He hath showed his people the power of his works,
In giving them the heritage of the nations.
111:7 The works of his hands are truth and justice;
All his precepts are sure.
111:8 They are established for ever and ever;
They are done in truth and uprightness.
111:9 He hath sent redemption unto his people;
He hath commanded his covenant for ever:
Holy and reverend is his name.
111:10 The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom;
A good understanding have all they that do his commandments:
His praise endureth for ever.
Psalm 112
112:1 Praise ye God.
Blessed is the man that feareth God,
That delighteth greatly in his commandments.
112:2 His seed shall be mighty upon earth:
The generation of the upright shall be blessed.
112:3 Wealth and riches are in his house;
And his righteousness endureth for ever.
112:4 Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness:
He is gracious, and merciful, and righteous.
112:5 Well is it with the man that dealeth graciously and lendeth;
He shall maintain his cause in judgment.
112:6 For he shall never be moved;
The righteous shall be had in everlasting remembrance.
112:7 He shall not be afraid of evil tidings:
His heart is fixed, trusting in God.
112:8 His heart is established, he shall not be afraid,
Until he see his desire upon his adversaries.
112:9 He hath dispersed, he hath given to the needy;
His righteousness endureth for ever:
His horn shall be exalted with honor.
112:10 The wicked shall see it, and be grieved;
He shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away:
The desire of the wicked shall perish.
Psalm 113
113:1 Praise ye God.
Praise, O ye servants of God,
Praise the name of God.
113:2 Blessed be the name of God
From this time forth and for evermore.
113:3 From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same
God’s name is to be praised.
113:4 God is high above all nations,
And his glory above the heavens.
113:5 Who is like unto God our God,
That hath his seat on high,
113:6 That humbleth himself to behold
The things that are in heaven and in the earth?
113:7 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust,
And lifteth up the needy from the dunghill;
113:8 That he may set him with princes,
Even with the princes of his people.
113:9 He maketh the barren woman to keep house,
And to be a joyful mother of children.
Praise ye God.
Psalm 114
114:1 When Israel went forth out of Egypt,
The house of Jacob from a people of strange language;
114:2 Judah became his sanctuary,
Israel his dominion.
114:3 The sea saw it, and fled;
The Jordan was driven back.
114:4 The mountains skipped like rams,
The little hills like lambs.
114:5 What aileth thee, O thou sea, that thou fleest?
Thou Jordan, that thou turnest back?
114:6 Ye mountains, that ye skip like rams;
Ye little hills, like lambs?
114:7 Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord,
At the presence of the God of Jacob,
114:8 Who turned the rock into a pool of water,
The flint into a fountain of waters.
Psalm 115
115:1 Not unto us, O God, not unto us,
But unto thy name give glory,
For thy lovingkindness, and for thy truth’s sake.
115:2 Wherefore should the nations say,
Where is now their God?
115:3 But our God is in the heavens:
He hath done whatsoever he pleased.
115:4 Their idols are silver and gold,
The work of men’s hands.
115:5 They have mouths, but they speak not;
Eyes have they, but they see not;
115:6 They have ears, but they hear not;
Noses have they, but they smell not;
115:7 They have hands, but they handle not;
Feet have they, but they walk not;
Neither speak they through their throat.
115:8 They that make them shall be like unto them;
Yea, every one that trusteth in them.
115:9 O Israel, trust thou in God:
He is their help and their shield.
115:10 O house of Aaron, trust ye in God:
He is their help and their shield.
115:11 Ye that fear God, trust in God:
He is their help and their shield.
115:12 God hath been mindful of us; he will bless us:
He will bless the house of Israel;
He will bless the house of Aaron.
115:13 He will bless them that fear God,
Both small and great.
115:14 God increase you more and more,
You and your children.
115:15 Blessed are ye of God,
Who made heaven and earth.
115:16 The heavens are the heavens of God;
But the earth hath he given to the children of men.
115:17 The dead praise not God,
Neither any that go down into silence;
115:18 But we will bless God
From this time forth and for evermore.
Praise ye God.
Psalm 116
116:1 I love God, because he heareth
My voice and my supplications.
116:2 Because he hath inclined his ear unto me,
Therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.
116:3 The cords of death compassed me,
And the pains of Sheol gat hold upon me:
I found trouble and sorrow.
116:4 Then called I upon the name of God:
O God, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.
116:5 Gracious is God, and righteous;
Yea, our God is merciful.
116:6 God preserveth the simple:
I was brought low, and he saved me.
116:7 Return unto thy rest, O my soul;
For God hath dealt bountifully with thee.
116:8 For thou hast delivered my soul from death,
Mine eyes from tears,
And my feet from falling.
116:9 I will walk before God
In the land of the living.
116:10 I believe, for I will speak:
I was greatly afflicted:
116:11 I said in my haste,
All men are liars.
116:12 What shall I render unto God
For all his benefits toward me?
116:13 I will take the cup of salvation,
And call upon the name of God.
116:14 I will pay my vows unto God,
Yea, in the presence of all his people.
116:15 Precious in the sight of God
Is the death of his saints.
116:16 O God, truly I am thy servant:
I am thy servant, the son of thy handmaid;
Thou hast loosed my bonds.
116:17 I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving,
And will call upon the name of God.
116:18 I will pay my vows unto God,
Yea, in the presence of all his people,
116:19 In the courts of God’s house,
In the midst of thee, O Jerusalem.
Praise ye God.
Psalm 117
117:1 O praise God, all ye nations;
Laud him, all ye peoples.
117:2 For his lovingkindness is great toward us;
And the truth of God endureth for ever.
Praise ye God.
Psalm 118
118:1 Oh give thanks unto God; for he is good;
For his lovingkindness endureth for ever.
118:2 Let Israel now say,
That his lovingkindness endureth for ever.
118:3 Let the house of Aaron now say,
That his lovingkindness endureth for ever.
118:4 Let them now that fear God say,
That his lovingkindness endureth for ever.
118:5 Out of my distress I called upon God:
God answered me and set me in a large place.
118:6 God is on my side; I will not fear:
What can man do unto me?
118:7 God is on my side among them that help me:
Therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me.
118:8 It is better to take refuge in God
Than to put confidence in man.
118:9 It is better to take refuge in God
Than to put confidence in princes.
118:10 All nations compassed me about:
In the name of God I will cut them off.
118:11 They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about:
In the name of God I will cut them off.
118:12 They compassed me about like bees;
They are quenched as the fire of thorns:
In the name of God I will cut them off.
118:13 Thou didst thrust sore at me that I might fall;
But God helped me.
118:14 God is my strength and song;
And he is become my salvation.
118:15 The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tents of the righteous:
The right hand of God doeth valiantly.
118:16 The right hand of God is exalted:
The right hand of God doeth valiantly.
118:17 I shall not die, but live,
And declare the works of God.
118:18 God hath chastened me sore;
But he hath not given me over unto death.
118:19 Open to me the gates of righteousness:
I will enter into them, I will give thanks unto God.
118:20 This is the gate of God;
The righteous shall enter into it.
118:21 I will give thanks unto thee; for thou hast answered me,
And art become my salvation.
118:22 The stone which the builders rejected Is become the head of the corner.
118:23 This is God’s doing;
It is marvellous in our eyes.
118:24 This is the day which God hath made;
We will rejoice and be glad in it.
118:25 Save now, we beseech thee, O God:
O God, we beseech thee, send now prosperity.
118:26 Blessed be he that cometh in the name of God:
We have blessed you out of the house of God.
118:27 God is God, and he hath given us light:
Bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar.
118:28 Thou art my God, and I will give thanks unto thee:
Thou art my God, I will exalt thee.
118:29 Oh give thanks unto God; for he is good;
For his lovingkindness endureth for ever.
Psalm 119
ALEPH.
119:1 Blessed are they that are perfect in the way,
Who walk in the law of God.
119:2 Blessed are they that keep his testimonies,
That seek him with the whole heart.
119:3 Yea, they do no unrighteousness;
They walk in his ways.
119:4 Thou hast commanded us thy precepts,
That we should observe them diligently.
119:5 Oh that my ways were established
To observe thy statutes!
119:6 Then shall I not be put to shame,
When I have respect unto all thy commandments.
119:7 I will give thanks unto thee with uprightness of heart,
When I learn thy righteous judgments.
119:8 I will observe thy statutes:
Oh forsake me not utterly.
BETH.
119:9 Wherewith shall a young man cleanse his way?
By taking heed thereto according to thy word.
119:10 With my whole heart have I sought thee:
Oh let me not wander from thy commandments.
119:11 Thy word have I laid up in my heart,
That I might not sin against thee.
119:12 Blessed art thou, O God:
Teach me thy statutes.
119:13 With my lips have I declared
All the ordinances of thy mouth.
119:14 I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies,
As much as in all riches.
119:15 I will meditate on thy precepts,
And have respect unto thy ways.
119:16 I will delight myself in thy statutes:
I will not forget thy word.
GIMEL.
119:17 Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live;
So will I observe thy word.
119:18 Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold
Wondrous things out of thy law.
119:19 I am a sojourner in the earth:
Hide not thy commandments from me.
119:20 My soul breaketh for the longing
That it hath unto thine ordinances at all times.
119:21 Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed,
That do wander from thy commandments.
119:22 Take away from me reproach and contempt;
For I have kept thy testimonies.
119:23 Princes also sat and talked against me;
But thy servant did meditate on thy statutes.
119:24 Thy testimonies also are my delight
And my counsellors.
DALETH.
119:25 My soul cleaveth unto the dust:
Quicken thou me according to thy word.
119:26 I declared my ways, and thou answeredst me:
Teach me thy statutes.
119:27 Make me to understand the way of thy precepts:
So shall I meditate on thy wondrous works.
119:28 My soul melteth for heaviness:
Strengthen thou me according unto thy word.
119:29 Remove from me the way of falsehood;
And grant me thy law graciously.
119:30 I have chosen the way of faithfulness:
Thine ordinances have I set before me.
119:31 I cleave unto thy testimonies:
O God, put me not to shame.
119:32 I will run the way of thy commandments,
When thou shalt enlarge my heart.
HE.
119:33 Teach me, O God, the way of thy statutes;
And I shall keep it unto the end.
119:34 Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law;
Yea, I shall observe it with my whole heart.
119:35 Make me to go in the path of thy commandments;
For therein do I delight.
119:36 Incline my heart unto thy testimonies,
And not to covetousness.
119:37 Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity,
And quicken me in thy ways.
119:38 Confirm unto thy servant thy word,
Which is in order unto the fear of thee.
119:39 Turn away my reproach whereof I am afraid;
For thine ordinances are good.
119:40 Behold, I have longed after thy precepts:
Quicken me in thy righteousness.
VAV.
119:41 Let thy lovingkindnesses also come unto me, O God,
Even thy salvation, according to thy word.
119:42 So shall I have an answer for him that reproacheth me;
For I trust in thy word.
119:43 And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth;
For I have hoped in thine ordinances.
119:44 So shall I observe thy law continually
For ever and ever.
119:45 And I shall walk at liberty;
For I have sought thy precepts.
119:46 I will also speak of thy testimonies before kings,
And shall not be put to shame.
119:47 And I will delight myself in thy commandments,
Which I have loved.
119:48 I will lift up my hands also unto thy commandments, which I have loved;
And I will meditate on thy statutes.
ZAYIN.
119:49 Remember the word unto thy servant,
Because thou hast made me to hope.
119:50 This is my comfort in my affliction;
For thy word hath quickened me.
119:51 The proud have had me greatly in derision:
Yet have I not swerved from thy law.
119:52 I have remembered thine ordinances of old, O God,
And have comforted myself.
119:53 Hot indignation hath taken hold upon me,
Because of the wicked that forsake thy law.
119:54 Thy statutes have been my songs
In the house of my pilgrimage.
119:55 I have remembered thy name, O God, in the night,
And have observed thy law.
119:56 This I have had,
Because I have kept thy precepts.
HHETH.
119:57 God is my portion:
I have said that I would observe thy words.
119:58 I entreated thy favor with my whole heart:
Be merciful unto me according to thy word.
119:59 I thought on my ways,
And turned my feet unto thy testimonies.
119:60 I made haste, and delayed not,
To observe thy commandments.
119:61 The cords of the wicked have wrapped me round;
But I have not forgotten thy law.
119:62 At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee
Because of thy righteous ordinances.
119:63 I am a companion of all them that fear thee,
And of them that observe thy precepts.
119:64 The earth, O God, is full of thy lovingkindness:
Teach me thy statutes.
TETH.
119:65 Thou hast dealt well with thy servant,
O God, according unto thy word.
119:66 Teach me good judgment and knowledge;
For I have believed in thy commandments.
119:67 Before I was afflicted I went astray;
But now I observe thy word.
119:68 Thou art good, and doest good;
Teach me thy statutes.
119:69 The proud have forged a lie against me:
With my whole heart will I keep thy precepts.
119:70 Their heart is as fat as grease;
But I delight in thy law.
119:71 It is good for me that I have been afflicted;
That I may learn thy statutes.
119:72 The law of thy mouth is better unto me
Than thousands of gold and silver.
YODH.
119:73 Thy hands have made me and fashioned me:
Give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.
119:74 They that fear thee shall see me and be glad,
Because I have hoped in thy word.
119:75 I know, O God, that thy judgments are righteous,
And that in faithfulness thou hast afflicted me.
119:76 Let, I pray thee, thy lovingkindness be for my comfort,
According to thy word unto thy servant.
119:77 Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live;
For thy law is my delight.
119:78 Let the proud be put to shame;
For they have overthrown me wrongfully:
But I will meditate on thy precepts.
119:79 Let those that fear thee turn unto me;
And they shall know thy testimonies.
119:80 Let my heart be perfect in thy statutes,
That I be not put to shame.
KAPH.
119:81 My soul fainteth for thy salvation;
But I hope in thy word.
119:82 Mine eyes fail for thy word,
While I say, When wilt thou comfort me?
119:83 For I am become like a wine-skin in the smoke;
Yet do I not forget thy statutes.
119:84 How many are the days of thy servant?
When wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?
119:85 The proud have digged pits for me,
Who are not according to thy law.
119:86 All thy commandments are faithful:
They persecute me wrongfully; help thou me.
119:87 They had almost consumed me upon earth;
But I forsook not thy precepts.
119:88 Quicken me after thy lovingkindness;
So shall I observe the testimony of thy mouth.
LAMEDH.
119:89 For ever, O God,
Thy word is settled in heaven.
119:90 Thy faithfulness is unto all generations:
Thou hast established the earth, and it abideth.
119:91 They abide this day according to thine ordinances;
For all things are thy servants.
119:92 Unless thy law had been my delight,
I should then have perished in mine affliction.
119:93 I will never forget thy precepts;
For with them thou hast quickened me.
119:94 I am thine, save me;
For I have sought thy precepts.
119:95 The wicked have waited for me, to destroy me;
But I will consider thy testimonies.
MEM.
119:96 I have seen an end of all perfection;
But thy commandment is exceeding broad.
119:97 Oh how love I thy law!
It is my meditation all the day.
119:98 Thy commandments make me wiser than mine enemies;
For they are ever with me.
119:99 I have more understanding than all my teachers;
For thy testimonies are my meditation.
119:100 I understand more than the aged,
Because I have kept thy precepts.
119:101 I have refrained my feet from every evil way,
That I might observe thy word.
119:102 I have not turned aside from thine ordinances;
For thou hast taught me.
119:103 How sweet are thy words unto my taste!
Yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!
119:104 Through thy precepts I get understanding:
Therefore I hate every false way.
NUN.
119:105 Thy word is a lamp unto my feet,
And light unto my path.
119:106 I have sworn, and have confirmed it,
That I will observe thy righteous ordinances.
119:107 I am afflicted very much:
Quicken me, O God, according unto thy word.
119:108 Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill-offerings of my mouth, O God,
And teach me thine ordinances.
119:109 My soul is continually in my hand;
Yet do I not forget thy law.
119:110 The wicked have laid a snare for me;
Yet have I not gone astray from thy precepts.
119:111 Thy testimonies have I taken as a heritage for ever;
For they are the rejoicing of my heart.
119:112 I have inclined my heart to perform thy statutes
For ever, even unto the end.
SAMEKH.
119:113 I hate them that are of a double mind;
But thy law do I love.
119:114 Thou art my hiding-place and my shield:
I hope in thy word.
119:115 Depart from me, ye evil-doers,
That I may keep the commandments of my God.
119:116 Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live;
And let me not be ashamed of my hope.
119:117 Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe,
And shall have respect unto thy statutes continually.
119:118 Thou hast set at nought all them that err from thy statutes;
For their deceit is falsehood.
119:119 Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross:
Therefore I love thy testimonies.
119:120 My flesh trembleth for fear of thee;
And I am afraid of thy judgments.
AYIN.
119:121 I have done justice and righteousness:
Leave me not to mine oppressors.
119:122 Be surety for thy servant for good:
Let not the proud oppress me.
119:123 Mine eyes fail for thy salvation,
And for thy righteous word.
119:124 Deal with thy servant according unto thy lovingkindness,
And teach me thy statutes.
119:125 I am thy servant; give me understanding,
That I may know thy testimonies.
119:126 It is time for God to work;
For they have made void thy law.
119:127 Therefore I love thy commandments
Above gold, yea, above fine gold.
119:128 Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right;
And I hate every false way.
PE.
119:129 Thy testimonies are wonderful;
Therefore doth my soul keep them.
119:130 The opening of thy words giveth light;
It giveth understanding unto the simple.
119:131 I opened wide my mouth, and panted;
For I longed for thy commandments.
119:132 Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me,
As thou usest to do unto those that love thy name.
119:133 Establish my footsteps in thy word;
And let not any iniquity have dominion over me.
119:134 Redeem me from the oppression of man:
So will I observe thy precepts.
119:135 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant;
And teach me thy statutes.
119:136 Streams of water run down mine eyes,
Because they observe not thy law.
TSADHE.
119:137 Righteous art thou, O God,
And upright are thy judgments.
119:138 Thou hast commanded thy testimonies in righteousness
And very faithfulness.
119:139 My zeal hath consumed me,
Because mine adversaries have forgotten thy words.
119:140 Thy word is very pure;
Therefore thy servant loveth it.
119:141 I am small and despised;
Yet do I not forget thy precepts.
119:142 Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness,
And thy law is truth.
119:143 Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me;
Yet thy commandments are my delight.
119:144 Thy testimonies are righteous for ever:
Give me understanding, and I shall live.
QOPH.
119:145 I have called with my whole heart; answer me, O God:
I will keep thy statutes.
119:146 I have called unto thee; save me,
And I shall observe thy testimonies.
119:147 I anticipated the dawning of the morning, and cried:
I hoped in thy words.
119:148 Mine eyes anticipated the night-watches,
That I might meditate on thy word.
119:149 Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness:
Quicken me, O God, according to thine ordinances.
119:150 They draw nigh that follow after wickedness;
They are far from thy law.
119:151 Thou art nigh, O God;
And all thy commandments are truth.
119:152 Of old have I known from thy testimonies,
That thou hast founded them for ever.
RESH.
119:153 Consider mine affliction, and deliver me;
For I do not forget thy law.
119:154 Plead thou my cause, and redeem me:
Quicken me according to thy word.
119:155 Salvation is far from the wicked;
For they seek not thy statutes.
119:156 Great are thy tender mercies, O God:
Quicken me according to thine ordinances.
119:157 Many are my persecutors and mine adversaries;
Yet have I not swerved from thy testimonies.
119:158 I beheld the treacherous, and was grieved,
Because they observe not thy word.
119:159 Consider how I love thy precepts:
Quicken me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness.
119:160 The sum of thy word is truth;
And every one of thy righteous ordinances endureth for ever.
SHIN.
119:161 Princes have persecuted me without a cause;
But my heart standeth in awe of thy words.
119:162 I rejoice at thy word,
As one that findeth great spoil.
119:163 I hate and abhor falsehood;
But thy law do I love.
119:164 Seven times a day do I praise thee,
Because of thy righteous ordinances.
119:165 Great peace have they that love thy law;
And they have no occasion of stumbling.
119:166 I have hoped for thy salvation, O God,
And have done thy commandments.
119:167 My soul hath observed thy testimonies;
And I love them exceedingly.
119:168 I have observed thy precepts and thy testimonies;
For all my ways are before thee.
TAV.
119:169 Let my cry come near before thee, O God:
Give me understanding according to thy word.
119:170 Let my supplication come before thee:
Deliver me according to thy word.
119:171 Let my lips utter praise;
For thou teachest me thy statutes.
119:172 Let my tongue sing of thy word;
For all thy commandments are righteousness.
119:173 Let thy hand be ready to help me;
For I have chosen thy precepts.
119:174 I have longed for thy salvation, O God;
And thy law is my delight.
119:175 Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee;
And let thine ordinances help me.
119:176 I have gone astray like a lost sheep;
Seek thy servant;
For I do not forget thy commandments.
Psalm 120
A Song of Ascents.
120:1 In my distress I cried unto God,
And he answered me.
120:2 Deliver my soul, O God, from lying lips,
And from a deceitful tongue.
120:3 What shall be given unto thee, and what shall be done more unto thee,
Thou deceitful tongue?
120:4 Sharp arrows of the mighty,
With coals of juniper.
120:5 Woe is me, that I sojourn in Meshech,
That I dwell among the tents of Kedar!
120:6 My soul hath long had her dwelling
With him that hateth peace.
120:7 I am for peace:
But when I speak, they are for war.
Psalm 121
A Song of Ascents.
121:1 I will lift up mine eyes unto the mountains:
From whence shall my help come?
121:2 My help cometh from God,
Who made heaven and earth.
121:3 He will not suffer thy foot to be moved:
He that keepeth thee will not slumber.
121:4 Behold, he that keepeth Israel
Will neither slumber nor sleep.
121:5 God is thy keeper:
God is thy shade upon thy right hand.
121:6 The sun shall not smite thee by day,
Nor the moon by night.
121:7 God will keep thee from all evil;
He will keep thy soul.
121:8 God will keep thy going out and thy coming in
From this time forth and for evermore.
Psalm 122
A Song of Ascents; of David.
122:1 I was glad when they said unto me,
Let us go unto the house of God.
122:2 Our feet are standing
Within thy gates, O Jerusalem,
122:3 Jerusalem, that art builded
As a city that is compact together;
122:4 Whither the tribes go up, even the tribes of God,
For an ordinance for Israel,
To give thanks unto the name of God.
122:5 For there are set thrones for judgment,
The thrones of the house of David.
122:6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem:
They shall prosper that love thee.
122:7 Peace be within thy walls,
And prosperity within thy palaces.
122:8 For my brethren and companions’ sakes,
I will now say, Peace be within thee.
122:9 For the sake of the house of God our God
I will seek thy good.
Psalm 123
A Song of Ascents.
123:1 Unto thee do I lift up mine eyes,
O thou that sittest in the heavens.
123:2 Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their master,
As the eyes of a maid unto the hand of her mistress;
So our eyes look unto God our God,
Until he have mercy upon us.
123:3 Have mercy upon us, O God, have mercy upon us;
For we are exceedingly filled with contempt.
123:4 Our soul is exceedingly filled
With the scoffing of those that are at ease,
And with the contempt of the proud.
Psalm 124
A Song of Ascents; of David.
124:1 If it had not been God who was on our side,
Let Israel now say,
124:2 If it had not been God who was on our side,
When men rose up against us;
124:3 Then they had swallowed us up alive,
When their wrath was kindled against us;
124:4 Then the waters had overwhelmed us,
The stream had gone over our soul;
124:5 Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.
124:6 Blessed be God,
Who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth.
124:7 Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers:
The snare is broken, and we are escaped.
124:8 Our help is in the name of God,
Who made heaven and earth.
Psalm 125
A Song of Ascents.
125:1 They that trust in God
Are as mount Zion, which cannot be moved, but abideth for ever.
125:2 As the mountains are round about Jerusalem,
So God is round about his people
From this time forth and for evermore.
125:3 For the sceptre of wickedness shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous;
That the righteous put not forth their hands unto iniquity.
125:4 Do good, O God, unto those that are good,
And to them that are upright in their hearts.
125:5 But as for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways,
God will lead them forth with the workers of iniquity.
Peace be upon Israel.
Psalm 126
A Song of Ascents.
126:1 When God brought back those that returned to Zion,
We were like unto them that dream.
126:2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter,
And our tongue with singing:
Then said they among the nations,
God hath done great things for them.
126:3 God hath done great things for us,
Whereof we are glad.
126:4 Turn again our captivity, O God,
As the streams in the South.
126:5 They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.
126:6 He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing seed for sowing,
Shall doubtless come again with joy, bringing his sheaves with him.
Psalm 127
A Song of Ascents; of Solomon.
127:1 Except God build the house,
They labor in vain that build it:
Except God keep the city,
The watchman waketh but in vain.
127:2 It is vain for you to rise up early,
To take rest late,
To eat the bread of toil;
For so he giveth unto his beloved sleep.
127:3 Lo, children are a heritage of God;
And the fruit of the womb is his reward.
127:4 As arrows in the hand of a mighty man,
So are the children of youth.
127:5 Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them:
They shall not be put to shame,
When they speak with their enemies in the gate.
Psalm 128
A Song of Ascents.
128:1 Blessed is every one that feareth God,
That walketh in his ways.
128:2 For thou shalt eat the labor of thy hands:
Happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee.
128:3 Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine,
In the innermost parts of thy house;
Thy children like olive plants,
Round about thy table.
128:4 Behold, thus shall the man be blessed
That feareth God.
128:5 God bless thee out of Zion:
And see thou the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.
128:6 Yea, see thou thy children’s children.
Peace be upon Israel.
Psalm 129
A Song of Ascents.
129:1 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth up,
Let Israel now say,
129:2 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth up:
Yet they have not prevailed against me.
129:3 The plowers plowed upon my back;
They made long their furrows.
129:4 God is righteous:
He hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.
129:5 Let them be put to shame and turned backward,
All they that hate Zion.
129:6 Let them be as the grass upon the housetops,
Which withereth before it groweth up;
129:7 Wherewith the reaper filleth not his hand,
Nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom.
129:8 Neither do they that go by say,
The blessing of God be upon you;
We bless you in the name of God.
Psalm 130
A Song of Ascents.
130:1 Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O God.
130:2 Lord, hear my voice: 
Let thine ears be attentive 
To the voice of my supplications. 
130:3 If thou, God, shouldest mark iniquities, 
O Lord, who could stand? 
130:4 But there is forgiveness with thee, 
That thou mayest be feared.
130:5 I wait for God, my soul doth wait, 
And in his word do I hope.
130:6 My soul waiteth for the Lord
More than watchmen wait for the morning;
Yea, more than watchmen for the morning.
130:7 O Israel, hope in God;
For with God there is lovingkindness,
And with him is plenteous redemption.
130:8 And he will redeem Israel
From all his iniquities.
Psalm 131
A Song of Ascents; of David.
131:1 God, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty;
Neither do I exercise myself in great matters,
Or in things too wonderful for me.
131:2 Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul;
Like a weaned child with his mother,
Like a weaned child is my soul within me.
131:3 O Israel, hope in God
From this time forth and for evermore.
Psalm 132
A Song of Ascents.
132:1 God, remember for David
All his affliction;
132:2 How he sware unto God,
And vowed unto the Mighty One of Jacob:
132:3 Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house,
Nor go up into my bed;
132:4 I will not give sleep to mine eyes,
Or slumber to mine eyelids;
132:5 Until I find out a place for God,
A tabernacle for the Mighty One of Jacob.
132:6 Lo, we heard of it in Ephrathah:
We found it in the field of the wood.
132:7 We will go into his tabernacles;
We will worship at his footstool.
132:8 Arise, O God, into thy resting-place;
Thou, and the ark of thy strength.
132:9 Let thy priest be clothed with righteousness;
And let thy saints shout for joy.
132:10 For thy servant David’s sake
Turn not away the face of thine anointed.
132:11 God hath sworn unto David in truth;
He will not turn from it:
Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.
132:12 If thy children will keep my covenant
And my testimony that I shall teach them,
Their children also shall sit upon thy throne for evermore.
132:13 For God hath chosen Zion;
He hath desired it for his habitation.
132:14 This is my resting-place for ever:
Here will I dwell; for I have desired it.
132:15 I will abundantly bless her provision:
I will satisfy her poor with bread.
132:16 Her priests also will I clothe with salvation;
And her saints shall shout aloud for joy.
132:17 There will I make the horn of David to bud:
I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.
132:18 His enemies will I clothe with shame;
But upon himself shall his crown flourish.
Psalm 133
A Song of Ascents; of David.
133:1 Behold, how good and how pleasant it is
For brethren to dwell together in unity!
133:2 It is like the precious oil upon the head,
That ran down upon the beard,
Even Aaron’s beard;
That came down upon the skirt of his garments;
133:3 Like the dew of Hermon,
That cometh down upon the mountains of Zion:
For there God commanded the blessing,
Even life for evermore.
Psalm 134
A Song of Ascents.
134:1 Behold, bless ye God, all ye servants of God,
That by night stand in the house of God.
134:2 Lift up your hands to the sanctuary,
And bless ye God.
134:3 God bless thee out of Zion;
Even he that made heaven and earth.
Psalm 135
135:1 Praise ye God.
Praise ye the name of God;
Praise him, O ye servants of God,
135:2 Ye that stand in the house of God,
In the courts of the house of our God.
135:3 Praise ye God; for God is good:
Sing praises unto his name; for it is pleasant.
135:4 For God hath chosen Jacob unto himself,
And Israel for his own possession.
135:5 For I know that God is great,
And that our Lord is above all gods.
135:6 Whatsoever God pleased, that hath he done,
In heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps;
135:7 Who causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth;
Who maketh lightnings for the rain;
Who bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries;
135:8 Who smote the first-born of Egypt,
Both of man and beast;
135:9 Who sent signs and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt,
Upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants;
135:10 Who smote many nations,
And slew mighty kings,
135:11 Sihon king of the Amorites,
And Og king of Bashan,
And all the kingdoms of Canaan,
135:12 And gave their land for a heritage,
A heritage unto Israel his people.
135:13 Thy name, O God, endureth for ever;
Thy memorial name, O God, throughout all generations.
135:14 For God will judge his people,
And repent himself concerning his servants.
135:15 The idols of the nations are silver and gold,
The work of men’s hands.
135:16 They have mouths, but they speak not;
Eyes have they, but they see not;
135:17 They have ears, but they hear not;
Neither is there any breath in their mouths.
135:18 They that make them shall be like unto them;
Yea, every one that trusteth in them.
135:19 O house of Israel, bless ye God:
O house of Aaron, bless ye God:
135:20 O house of Levi, bless ye God:
Ye that fear God, bless ye God.
135:21 Blessed be God out of Zion,
Who dwelleth at Jerusalem.
Praise ye God.

For his lovingkindness endureth for ever:

For his lovingkindness endureth for ever:
136:10 To him that smote Egypt in their first-born;

136:11 And brought out Israel from among them;
For his lovingkindness endureth for ever;
136:12 With a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm;
For his lovingkindness endureth for ever:
136:13 To him that divided the Red Sea in sunder;
For his lovingkindness endureth for ever;
136:14 And made Israel to pass through the midst of it;
For his lovingkindness endureth for ever;
136:15 But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red Sea;
For his lovingkindness endureth for ever:
136:16 To him that led his people through the wilderness;
For his lovingkindness endureth for ever:
136:17 To him that smote great kings;
For his lovingkindness endureth for ever;
136:18 And slew famous kings;
For his lovingkindness endureth for ever:
136:19 Sihon king of the Amorites;
For his lovingkindness endureth forever;
136:20 And Og king of Bashan;
For his lovingkindness endureth for ever;
136:21 And gave their land for a heritage;
For his lovingkindness endureth for ever;
136:22 Even a heritage unto Israel his servant;
For his lovingkindness endureth for ever:
136:23 Who remembered us in our low estate;
For his lovingkindness endureth for ever;
136:24 And hath delivered us from our adversaries;
For his lovingkindness endureth for ever:
136:25 Who giveth food to all flesh;
For his lovingkindness endureth for ever.
136:26 Oh give thanks unto the God of heaven;
For his lovingkindness endureth for ever.
Psalm 137
137:1 By the rivers of Babylon,
There we sat down, yea, we wept,
When we remembered Zion.
137:2 Upon the willows in the midst thereof We hanged up our harps.
137:3 For there they that led us captive required of us songs,
And they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying,
Sing us one of the songs of Zion.
137:4 How shall we sing God’s song
In a foreign land?
137:5 If I forget thee, O Jerusalem,
Let my right hand forget her skill.
137:6 Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth,
If I remember thee not;
If I prefer not Jerusalem
Above my chief joy.
137:7 Remember, O God, against the children of Edom
The day of Jerusalem;
Who said, Rase it, rase it,
Even to the foundation thereof.
137:8 O daughter of Babylon, that art to be destroyed,
Happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee
As thou hast served us.
137:9 Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones
Against the rock.
Psalm 138
A Psalm of David.
138:1 I will give thee thanks with my whole heart:
Before the gods will I sing praises unto thee.
138:2 I will worship toward thy holy temple,
And give thanks unto thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth:
For thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name.
138:3 In the day that I called thou answeredst me,
Thou didst encourage me with strength in my soul.
138:4 All the kings of the earth shall give thee thanks, O God,
For they have heard the words of thy mouth.
138:5 Yea, they shall sing of the ways of God;
For great is the glory of God.
138:6 For though God is high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly;
But the haughty he knoweth from afar.
138:7 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me;
Thou wilt stretch forth thy hand against the wrath of mine enemies,
And thy right hand will save me.
138:8 God will perfect that which concerneth me:
Thy lovingkindness, O God, endureth for ever;
Forsake not the works of thine own hands.
Psalm 139
For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.
139:1 O God, thou hast searched me, and known me.
139:2 Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising;
Thou understandest my thought afar off.
139:3 Thou searchest out my path and my lying down,
And art acquainted with all my ways.
139:4 For there is not a word in my tongue,
But, lo, O God, thou knowest it altogether.
139:5 Thou hast beset me behind and before,
And laid thy hand upon me.
139:6 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me;
It is high, I cannot attain unto it.
139:7 Whither shall I go from thy Spirit?
Or whither shall I flee from thy presence?
139:8 If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there:
If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, thou art there.
139:9 If I take the wings of the morning,
And dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;
139:10 Even there shall thy hand lead me,
And thy right hand shall hold me.
139:11 If I say, Surely the darkness shall overwhelm me,
And the light about me shall be night;
139:12 Even the darkness hideth not from thee,
But the night shineth as the day:
The darkness and the light are both alike to thee.
139:13 For thou didst form my inward parts:
Thou didst cover me in my mother’s womb.
139:14 I will give thanks unto thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made:
Wonderful are thy works;
And that my soul knoweth right well.
139:15 My frame was not hidden from thee,
When I was made in secret,
And curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.
139:16 Thine eyes did see mine unformed substance;
And in thy book they were all written,
Even the days that were ordained for me,
When as yet there was none of them.
139:17 How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God!
How great is the sum of them!
139:18 If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand:
When I awake, I am still with thee.
139:19 Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God:
Depart from me therefore, ye bloodthirsty men.
139:20 For they speak against thee wickedly,
And thine enemies take thy name in vain.
139:21 Do not I hate them, O God, that hate thee?
And am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?
139:22 I hate them with perfect hatred:
They are become mine enemies.
139:23 Search me, O God, and know my heart:
Try me, and know my thoughts;
139:24 And see if there be any wicked way in me,
And lead me in the way everlasting.
Psalm 140
For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.
140:1 Deliver me, O God, from the evil man;
Preserve me from the violent man:
140:2 Who devise mischiefs in their heart;
Continually do they gather themselves together for war.
140:3 They have sharpened their tongue like a serpent;
Adders’ poison is under their lips. 
Selah
140:4 Keep me, O God, from the hands of the wicked;
Preserve me from the violent man:
Who have purposed to thrust aside my steps.
140:5 The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords;
They have spread a net by the wayside;
They have set gins for me.
Selah
140:6 I said unto God, Thou art my God:
Give ear unto the voice of my supplications, O God.
140:7 O God the Lord, the strength of my salvation,
Thou hast covered my head in the day of battle.
140:8 Grant not, O God, the desires of the wicked;
Further not his evil device, lest they exalt themselves.
Selah
140:9 As for the head of those that compass me about,
Let the mischief of their own lips cover them.
140:10 Let burning coals fall upon them:
Let them be cast into the fire,
Into deep pits, whence they shall not rise.
140:11 An evil speaker shall not be established in the earth:
Evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him.
140:12 I know that God will maintain the cause of the afflicted,
And justice for the needy.
140:13 Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name:
The upright shall dwell in thy presence.
Psalm 141
A Psalm of David.
141:1 God, I have called upon thee; make haste unto me:
Give ear unto my voice, when I call unto thee.
141:2 Let my prayer be set forth as incense before thee;
The lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.
141:3 Set a watch, O God, before my mouth;
Keep the door of my lips.
141:4 Incline not my heart to any evil thing,
To practise deeds of wickedness
With men that work iniquity:
And let me not eat of their dainties.
141:5 Let the righteous smite me, it shall be a kindness;
And let him reprove me, it shall be as oil upon the head;
Let not my head refuse it:
For even in their wickedness shall my prayer continue.
141:6 Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock;
And they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.
141:7 As when one ploweth and cleaveth the earth,
Our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol.
141:8 For mine eyes are unto thee, O God the Lord:
In thee do I take refuge; leave not my soul destitute.
141:9 Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me,
And from the gins of the workers of iniquity.
141:10 Let the wicked fall into their own nets,
Whilst that I withal escape.
Psalm 142
Maschil of David, when he was in the cave; a Prayer.
142:1 I cry with my voice unto God;
With my voice unto God do I make supplication.
142:2 I pour out my complaint before him;
I show before him my trouble.
142:3 When my spirit was overwhelmed within me,
Thou knewest my path.
In the way wherein I walk
Have they hidden a snare for me.
142:4 Look on my right hand, and see;
For there is no man that knoweth me:
Refuge hath failed me;
No man careth for my soul.
142:5 I cried unto thee, O God;
I said, Thou art my refuge,
My portion in the land of the living.
142:6 Attend unto my cry;
For I am brought very low:
Deliver me from my persecutors;
For they are stronger than I.
142:7 Bring my soul out of prison,
That I may give thanks unto thy name:
The righteous shall compass me about;
For thou wilt deal bountifully with me.
Psalm 143
A Psalm of David.
143:1 Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to my supplications:
In thy faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness.
143:2 And enter not into judgment with thy servant;
For in thy sight no man living is righteous.
143:3 For the enemy hath persecuted my soul;
He hath smitten my life down to the ground:
He hath made me to dwell in dark places, as those that have been long dead.
143:4 Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me;
My heart within me is desolate.
143:5 I remember the days of old;
I meditate on all thy doings;
I muse on the work of thy hands.
143:6 I spread forth my hands unto thee:
My soul thirsteth after thee, as a weary land.
Selah
143:7 Make haste to answer me, O God; my spirit faileth:
Hide not thy face from me,
Lest I become like them that go down into the pit.
143:8 Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning;
For in thee do I trust:
Cause me to know the way wherein I should walk;
For I lift up my soul unto thee.
143:9 Deliver me, O God, from mine enemies:
I flee unto thee to hide me.
143:10 Teach me to do thy will;
For thou art my God:
Thy Spirit is good;
Lead me in the land of uprightness.
143:11 Quicken me, O God, for thy name’s sake:
In thy righteousness bring my soul out of trouble.
143:12 And in thy lovingkindness cut off mine enemies,
And destroy all them that afflict my soul;
For I am thy servant.
Psalm 144
A Psalm of David.
144:1 Blessed be God my rock,
Who teacheth my hands to war,
And my fingers to fight:
144:2 My lovingkindness, and my fortress,
My high tower, and my deliverer;
My shield, and he in whom I take refuge;
Who subdueth my people under me.
144:3 God, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him?
Or the son of man, that thou makest account of him?
144:4 Man is like to vanity:
His days are as a shadow that passeth away.
144:5 Bow thy heavens, O God, and come down:
Touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.
144:6 Cast forth lightning, and scatter them;
Send out thine arrows, and discomfit them.
144:7 Stretch forth thy hand from above;
Rescue me, and deliver me out of great waters,
Out of the hand of aliens;
144:8 Whose mouth speaketh deceit,
And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
144:9 I will sing a new song unto thee, O God:
Upon a psaltery of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.
144:10 Thou art he that giveth salvation unto kings;
Who rescueth David his servant from the hurtful sword.
144:11 Rescue me, and deliver me out of the hand of aliens,
Whose mouth speaketh deceit,
And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
144:12 When our sons shall be as plants grown up in their youth,
And our daughters as corner-stones hewn after the fashion of a palace;
144:13 When our garners are full, affording all manner of store,
And our sheep bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our fields;
144:14 When our oxen are well laden;
When there is no breaking in, and no going forth,
And no outcry in our streets:
144:15 Happy is the people that is in such a case;
Yea, happy is the people whose God is God.
Psalm 145
A Psalm of praise; of David.
145:1 I will extol thee, my God, O King;
And I will bless thy name for ever and ever.
145:2 Every day will I bless thee;
And I will praise thy name for ever and ever.
145:3 Great is God, and greatly to be praised;
And his greatness is unsearchable.
145:4 One generation shall laud thy works to another,
And shall declare thy mighty acts.
145:5 Of the glorious majesty of thine honor,
And of thy wondrous works, will I meditate.
145:6 And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts;
And I will declare thy greatness.
145:7 They shall utter the memory of thy great goodness,
And shall sing of thy righteousness.
145:8 God is gracious, and merciful;
Slow to anger, and of great lovingkindness.
145:9 God is good to all;
And his tender mercies are over all his works.
145:10 All thy works shall give thanks unto thee, O God;
And thy saints shall bless thee.
145:11 They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom,
And talk of thy power;
145:12 To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts,
And the glory of the majesty of his kingdom.
145:13 Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom,
And thy dominion endureth throughout all generations.
145:14 God upholdeth all that fall,
And raiseth up all those that are bowed down.
145:15 The eyes of all wait for thee;
And thou givest them their food in due season.
145:16 Thou openest thy hand,
And satisfiest the desire of every living thing.
145:17 God is righteous in all his ways,
And gracious in all his works.
145:18 God is nigh unto all them that call upon him,
To all that call upon him in truth.
145:19 He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him;
He also will hear their cry and will save them.
145:20 God preserveth all them that love him;
But all the wicked will he destroy.
145:21 My mouth shall speak the praise of God;
And let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.
Psalm 146
146:1 Praise ye God.
Praise God, O my soul.
146:2 While I live will I praise God:
I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being.
146:3 Put not your trust in princes,
Nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.
146:4 His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth;
In that very day his thoughts perish.
146:5 Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help,
Whose hope is in God his God:
146:6 Who made heaven and earth,
The sea, and all that in them is;
Who keepeth truth for ever;
146:7 Who executeth justice for the oppressed;
Who giveth food to the hungry.
God looseth the prisoners;
146:8 God openeth the eyes of the blind;
God raiseth up them that are bowed down;
God loveth the righteous;
146:9 God preserveth the sojourners;
He upholdeth the fatherless and widow;
But the way of the wicked he turneth upside down.
146:10 God will reign for ever,
Thy God, O Zion, unto all generations.
Praise ye God.
Psalm 147
147:1 Praise ye God;
For it is good to sing praises unto our God;
For it is pleasant, and praise is comely.
147:2 God doth build up Jerusalem;
He gathereth together the outcasts of Israel.
147:3 He healeth the broken in heart,
And bindeth up their wounds.
147:4 He counteth the number of the stars;
He calleth them all by their names.
147:5 Great is our Lord, and mighty in power;
His understanding is infinite.
147:6 God upholdeth the meek:
He bringeth the wicked down to the ground.
147:7 Sing unto God with thanksgiving;
Sing praises upon the harp unto our God,
147:8 Who covereth the heavens with clouds,
Who prepareth rain for the earth,
Who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains.
147:9 He giveth to the beast his food,
And to the young ravens which cry.
147:10 He delighteth not in the strength of the horse:
He taketh no pleasure in the legs of a man.
147:11 God taketh pleasure in them that fear him,
In those that hope in his lovingkindness.
147:12 Praise God, O Jerusalem;
Praise thy God, O Zion.
147:13 For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates;
He hath blessed thy children within thee.
147:14 He maketh peace in thy borders;
He filleth thee with the finest of the wheat.
147:15 He sendeth out his commandment upon earth;
His word runneth very swiftly.
147:16 He giveth snow like wool;
He scattereth the hoar-frost like ashes.
147:17 He casteth forth his ice like morsels:
Who can stand before his cold?
147:18 He sendeth out his word, and melteth them:
He causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow.
147:19 He showeth his word unto Jacob,
His statutes and his ordinances unto Israel.
147:20 He hath not dealt so with any nation;
And as for his ordinances, they have not known them.
Praise ye God.

148:1 Praise ye God.
Praise ye God from the heavens:

Praise ye him, all his host.
148:3 Praise ye him, sun and moon:
Praise him, all ye stars of light.
148:4 Praise him, ye heavens of heavens,
And ye waters that are above the heavens.
148:5 Let them praise the name of God;
For he commanded, and they were created.

He hath made a decree which shall not pass away.
148:7 Praise God from the earth,
Ye sea-monsters, and all deeps.
148:8 Fire and hail, snow and vapor;
Stormy wind, fulfilling his word;

The praise of all his saints;
Even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him.
Praise ye God.

He will beautify the meek with salvation.
149:5 Let the saints exult in glory:
Let them sing for joy upon their beds.
149:6 Let the high praises of God be in their mouth,
And a two-edged sword in their hand;
149:7 To execute vengeance upon the nations,
And punishments upon the peoples;
149:8 To bind their kings with chains,
And their nobles with fetters of iron;
149:9 To execute upon them the judgment written:
This honor have all his saints.
Praise ye God.
Psalm 150
150:1 Praise ye God.
Praise God in his sanctuary:
Praise him in the firmament of his power.
150:2 Praise him for his mighty acts:
Praise him according to his excellent greatness.
150:3 Praise him with trumpet sound:
Praise him with psaltery and harp.
150:4 Praise him with timbrel and dance:
Praise him with stringed instruments and pipe.
150:5 Praise him with loud cymbals:
Praise him with high sounding cymbals.
150:6 Let everything that hath breath praise God.
Praise ye God.
